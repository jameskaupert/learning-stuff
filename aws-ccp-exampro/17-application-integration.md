# Application Integration

Application Integration = process of letting two independent applications communicate and work with each other, commonly facilitated by an intermediate system

Loose coupling is desirable for cloud systems/services, so AWS has many services designed around app integration

Common patterns include:

- queueing
- streaming
- pub/sub
- API gateways
- state machine
- event bus
