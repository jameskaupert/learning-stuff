# EC2

Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) = highly configurable virtual server / VM

- resizable compute capacity
- minutes to launch new instances
- anything and everything on AWS uses EC2 underneath

1. Choose OS via Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- Red Hat
- Ubuntu
- Windows
- Amazon Linux
- SUSE

2. Choose instance type
3. Add Storage (EBS/EFS)

- SSD
- HDD
- Virtual Magnetic Tape
- Multiple Volumes

4. Configure Instance

- security groups
- key pairs
- user data
- IAM roles
- placement groups

## EC2 Instance Families

Instance families = different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity

- allow you to choose the appropriate combination of capacity to meet your app's unique requirements
- different families use varying hardware to give them their unique properties

General Purpose

- balance of compute, memory, and networking
- Use Cases: web servers and code repositories

Compute Optimized

- start with "C"
- ideal for compute-bound apps that benefit from high performance processor
- Use Cases: scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines

Memory Optimized

- fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in-memory
- Use Cases: in-memory caches, in-memory databases, real-time big data analytics

Accelerated Optimized

- hardware accelerators or co-processors
- Use Cases: machine learning, computational finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition

Store Optimized

- high, sequential read/write access to very large data sets on local storage
- Use Cases: NoSQL, in-memory or transactional databases, data warehousing

## Instance Types

Instance Types = combination of size + family

Common patterns for instance sizes:

- nano
- micro
- small
- medium
- large
- xlarge
- 2xlarge
- 4xlarge
- etc...

EC2 instance sizes generally double in price and key attributes

## Dedicated Host

Dedicated hosts are single-tenant EC2 instances to let you bring your own license, based on machine characteristics

|                Feature                 |        Dedicated Instance         |                        Dedicated Host                         |
| :------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
|               Isolation                |        Instance isolation         |                   Physical server isolation                   |
|                Billing                 | per-instance billing + region fee |                       per-host billing                        |
| Visibility of Physical Characteristics |           No visibility           |                    sockets, cores, host ID                    |
|     affinity between host/instance     |            no affinity            | consistently deploy to same instances to same physical server |
|       targed instance placement        |            no control             | additional control over instance placement on physical server |
|      automatic instance placement      |                yes                |                              yes                              |
| add capacity using allocation request  |                no                 |                              yes                              |

## EC2 Tenancy

3 levels of tenancy on AWS

1. Dedicated Host

- your server lives here and you have control of the physical attributes

2. Deidcated Instance

- your server always lives here

3. Default

- your instance lives here until reboot
