# Identity

## Zero-Trust Model

> "Trust no one, verify everything."

Bad actors have proven that conventional access-controls can be bypassed such that traditional security measures are insufficient

Identity is the primary security perimeter in the Zero Trust model

Primary Security Perimeter = first line of defense to protect company resources and assets

Network-Centric (old way) = traditional security model focusing on firewalls and VPNs since few employees/workstations were outside the office, or they were in specific remote offices

Identity-Centric (new way) = bring-your-own-device, remote workstations are becoming much more common. Cannot trust if employee is in secure location. Identity-based security controls like MFA, or providing provisional access based on level of risk from where/when/what user wants to access

- does not replace, but augments network-centric security
