# TCO and Migration

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

TCO = financial estimate intended to help buyer and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or service. Includes items like:

- Hardware
- Taxes
- Licensing
- Security
- Software
- Training
- IT Personnel
- Installation
- Monitoring

Creating a TCO report is useful when looking to migrate from on-premise to the cloud

Cloud services can initially be more expensive than running on-premises data centers. They can, however, become cost-effective over time if organizations learn to use and operate them more efficiently

CAPEX (On-Premise)

- software license fees
- implementation
- configuration
- training
- physical security
- hardware
- IT personnel
- maintenance

OPEX (AWS)

- subscription fees
- implementation
- configuration
- training

AWS claims up to 75% savings on TCO
