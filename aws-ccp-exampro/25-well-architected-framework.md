# Well-Architected Framework

Well-Architected Framework = whitepaper created by AWS to help customers build using best-practices defined by AWS

https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected

Divided into sections called pillars which address different aspects or "lenses" that can be applied to a cloud workload

- general definitions
- general design principles
- the review process

If the foundation (based on the pillars) is not solid, structural problems will arise

Pillars

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainability

Each pillar has its own whitepaper too

### Well-Architected Framework - General Definitions

Operational Excellence = run and monitor systems
Security Pillar = protect data and systems, mitigate risk
Reliability Pillar = Mitigate and recover from disruptions
Performance Efficiency Pillar = use computing resources efficiently
Cost Optimization Pillar = get the lowest price

Sometimes pillars will need to be traded off against one another based on the business context to achieve the most business value

Component = code, configuration, and AWS resources against a requirement
Workload = set of components that work together to deliver business value
Milestones = key changes of your architecture through product lifecycle
Architecture = how components work together in a workload
Technology Portfolio = collection of workloads required for the business to operate
