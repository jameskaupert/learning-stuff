## Global Reach

## Reliability

- data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, fault tolerance

## High Availability

## Scalability

- scale up or down to meet current need and stop paying for idle or underutilized servers (stop guessing capacity)

## Elasticity

- automate scaling during spikes / drops in demand
