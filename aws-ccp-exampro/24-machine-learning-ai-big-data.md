# Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data

Artificial Intelligence (AI) = machines performing jobs that mimic human behavior

Machine Learning (ML) = machines that get better at a task without explicit programming

Deep Learning (DL) = machines that have an artificial neural network inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems

Amazon SageMaker = fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale

- Apache MXNet on AWS = open-source deep learning framework
- TensorFlow on AWS = open-source machine intelligence library
- PyTorch on AWS = open-source machine learning framework

Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth = data-labelling service. Datasets are labelled by humans in order to train machine learning models

Amazon Augmented AI = human-intervention review service. When SageMaker uses ML to make a prediction, it is not confident it has the right answer -> queue up the prediction for human review

## AI and ML Services

Amazon CodeGuru = ML code analysis service. Performs code-reviews and suggests changes to improve the quality of code. Can show visual code profiles to pinpoint performance

Amazon Lex = conversation interface service. Build voice and text chatbots

Amazon Personalize = real-time recommendations service. Same tech used to make product recommendations on Amazon commercial platform

Amazon Polly = text-to-speech service. Upload text and audio file spoken by a synthesized voice is generated

Amazon Rekognition = image and video recognition service. Analyze images and videos to detect and label objects, people, celebrities

Amazon Transcribe = speech-to-text service. Upload audio, convert to text

Amazon Textract = OCR (extract text from scanned documents) service. Paper forms to electronic

Amazon Translate = neural ML translation service. Uses deep learning models to deliver more accurate and natural sounding translations

Amazon Comprehend = Natural Language Processor (NLP) service. Find relationships between text to produce insights. Looks at data and makes predictions

Amazon Forecast = time-series forecasting service. Forecast business outcomes such as product demand, resource needs, and financial performance

AWS Deep Learning AMIs = EC2s pre-installed with popular deep learning frameworks and interfaces such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Chainer, Gluon, Horovod, and Keras

AWS Deep Learning Containers = Docker images preinstalled with popular deep learning frameworks and interfaces

AWS DeepComposer = ML-enabled musical keyboard

AWS DeepLens = video camera using deep learning

AWS DeepRacer = toy race car powered with ML to perform autonomous driving

Amazon Elastic Inference = attach low-cost GPU-powered acceleration to EC2 instances to reduce cost of running deep learning inference by up to 75%

Amazon Fraud Detector = fully managed fraud detection service. Identify potentially fraudulent online activities such as online payment fraud and creation of fake accounts

Amazon Kendra = enterprise ML search engine service. Uses natural language to suggest answers to a question instead of simple keyword matching
