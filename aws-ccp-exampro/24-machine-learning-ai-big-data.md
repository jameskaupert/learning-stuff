# Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data

Artificial Intelligence (AI) = machines performing jobs that mimic human behavior

Machine Learning (ML) = machines that get better at a task without explicit programming

Deep Learning (DL) = machines that have an artificial neural network inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems

Amazon SageMaker = fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale

- Apache MXNet on AWS = open-source deep learning framework
- TensorFlow on AWS = open-source machine intelligence library
- PyTorch on AWS = open-source machine learning framework

Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth = data-labelling service. Datasets are labelled by humans in order to train machine learning models

Amazon Augmented AI = human-intervention review service. When SageMaker uses ML to make a prediction, it is not confident it has the right answer -> queue up the prediction for human review
